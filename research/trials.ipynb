Physical evidence has the potential to play a\\ncritical role in the overall investigation and resolution of a suspected\\ncriminal act. Realization of this potential depends on actions taken early in\\nthe criminal investigation at the crime scene. Developments in technology\\nand improvements in the analysis and interpretation of physical evidence\\nrecovered from crime scenes will place even greater importance on prop-\\nerly documented and preserved evidence. An important factor influencing\\nthe ultimate legal significance of this scientific evidence is that investiga-\\ntors follow an objective, thorough, and thoughtful approach. The goal of\\nthis process is to recognize and preserve physical evidence that will yield\\nreliable information to aid in the investigation.\\nInvestigators should approach the crime scene investigation as if it will\\nbe their only opportunity to preserve and recover these physical clues.\\nThey should consider other case information or statements from wit-\\nnesses or suspects carefully in their objective assessment of the scene.\\nInvestigations may change course a number of times during such an\\ninquiry and physical clues, initially thought irrelevant, may become\\ncrucial to a successful resolution of the case.\\nIt is recognized that all crime scenes are unique. The judgment of the\\ninvestigator on the scene, with the assistance of other responders, such as\\nthe prosecutor, should be given deference in the implementation of this\\nguide. It is impossible to propose a single, step-by-step procedure to\\napproach every type of situation.

This document is not intended as a\\ncomprehensive or rigid scheme of activities, but as a guide for law\\nenforcement, while recognizing the authority of Federal and State\\nstatutes, case law, and local policies and procedures.\\nAlthough the development of a guide for crime scene investigation is\\ninstructive in addressing issues surrounding the management of crime\\nscenes, the Technical Working Group on Crime Scene Investigation\\n(TWGCSI) recognizes that local logistical and legal conditions may\\ndictate the use of alternative procedures. Further, crime scene investiga-\\ntion procedures that differ from the practices in this guide may not\\nnecessarily invalidate or detract from the evidence in a particular case.\\nThe authors encourage crime scene personnel to develop and continually\\nupdate their knowledge, skills, and abilities with respect to the processing\\nof a crime scene through training. In fact, successful implementation of\\nthis guide can be realized only if staff possess basic (and in some cases\\nadvanced) training in the fundamentals of investigating a crime scene.\\nHowever, this document does not address the mechanics of evidence\\ncollection\\n or the training requirements of investigative personnel.\\nThe application of this guide may vary from case to case. Most of the\\nprocedures described in this document are typically ones that would be\\nfollowed in a major crime scene investigation. Some of the procedures\\nlisted may not necessarily be followed in less serious or less complex\\ninvestigations. In addition, the order in which actions may be performed\\nwill vary depending on the nature of the particular crime scene. In some\\ninvestigations, the responsibilities described in each section may be\\nperformed by the same individual. The authors acknowledge that law\\nenforcement agencies may be faced with the dilemma of responding to\\nmore reported crimes than their resources allow.

In December 1998, TWGCSI assembled in\\nWashington, D.C., and, after introductory remarks, separated into four\\nbreakout sections to draft the guide. The four sections were: Arriving at\\nthe Scene: Initial Response/Prioritization of Efforts, Preliminary Docu-\\nmentation and Evaluation of the Scene, Processing the Scene, and\\nCompleting and Recording the Crime Scene Investigation. An editor\\nfrom Aspen Systems Corporation attended each breakout section to\\naudibly record the proceedings. Once all breakout sections completed\\ntheir work, the full TWG reassembled to review the initial draft.\\nThe full TWG met again in January 1999 in Washington, D.C., to make\\nrevisions and complete initial review as a group.

Created by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act\\nof 1968, as amended, NIJ is authorized to support research, evaluation, and demonstration programs,\\ndevelopment of technology, and both national and international information dissemination. Specific\\nmandates of the Act direct NIJ to:\\nu Sponsor special projects, and research and development programs, that will improve and strengthen\\nthe criminal justice system and reduce or prevent crime.\\nu Conduct national demonstration projects that employ innovative or promising approaches for\\nimproving criminal justice.\\nu Develop new technologies to fight crime and improve criminal justice.\\nu Evaluate the effectiveness of criminal justice programs and identify programs that promise to be\\nsuccessful if continued or repeated.\\nu Recommend actions that can be taken by Federal, State, and local governments as well as by private\\norganizations to improve criminal justice.\\nu Carry out research on criminal behavior.\\nu Develop new methods of crime prevention and reduction of crime and delinquency.\\nIn recent years, NIJ has greatly expanded its initiatives, the result of the Violent Crime Control and Law\\nEnforcement Act of 1994 (the Crime Act), partnerships with other Federal agencies and private\\nfoundations, advances in technology, and a new international focus. Some examples of these new\\ninitiatives:\\nu New research and evaluation is exploring key issues in community policing, violence against\\nwomen, sentencing reforms, and specialized courts such as drug courts.\\nu Dual-use technologies are being developed to support national defense and local law enforcement\\nneeds.\\nu Four regional National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Centers and a Border\\nResearch and Technology Center have joined the National Center in Rockville, Maryland.\\nu The causes, treatment, and prevention of violence against women and violence within the family are\\nbeing investigated in cooperation with several agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and\\nHuman Services.\\nu NIJ's links with the international community are being strengthened through membership in the\\nUnited Nations network of criminological institutes; participation in developing the U.N. Criminal\\nJustice Information Network; initiation of UNOJUST (U.N. Online Justice Clearinghouse), which\\nelectronically links the institutes to the U.N. network; and establishment of an NIJ International\\nCenter.\\nu The NIJ-administered criminal justice information clearinghouse, the world’s largest, has improved\\nits online capability.\\nu The Institute’s Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program has been expanded and enhanced. Renamed\\nADAM (Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring), the program will increase the number of drug-testing\\nsites, and its role as a “platform” for studying drug-related crime will grow.\\nu NIJ’s new Crime Mapping Research Center will provide training in computer mapping technology,\\ncollect and archive geocoded crime data, and develop analytic software.\\nu The Institute’s program of intramural research has been expanded and enhanced.\\nThe Institute Director, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, establishes the\\nInstitute's objectives, guided by the priorities of the Office of Justice Programs, the Department of\\nJustice, and the needs of the criminal justice field. The Institute actively solicits the views of criminal\\njustice professionals and researchers in the continuing search for answers that inform public\\npolicymaking in crime and justice.\\nFor information on the National Institute of Justice, please contact:\\nNational Criminal Justice Reference Service\\nBox 6000\\nRockville, MD 20849–6000\\n800–851–3420\\ne-mail: askncjrs@ncjrs.org\\nYou can view or obtain an electronic version of this document from the\\nNCJRS Justice Information Center World Wide Web site.\\nTo access this site, go to http://www.ncjrs.org\\nIf you have questions, call or e-mail NCJRS.\")]"

Physical evidence has the potential to play a\\ncritical role in the overall investigation and resolution of a suspected\\ncriminal act. Realization of this potential depends on actions taken early in\\nthe criminal investigation at the crime scene. Developments in technology\\nand improvements in the analysis and interpretation of physical evidence\\nrecovered from crime scenes will place even greater importance on prop-\\nerly documented and preserved evidence. An important factor influencing\\nthe ultimate legal significance of this scientific evidence is that investiga-\\ntors follow an objective, thorough, and thoughtful approach. The goal of\\nthis process is to recognize and preserve physical evidence that will yield\\nreliable information to aid in the investigation.\\nInvestigators should approach the crime scene investigation as if it will\\nbe their only opportunity to preserve and recover these physical clues.\\nThey should consider other case information or statements from wit-\\nnesses or suspects carefully in their objective assessment of the scene.\\nInvestigations may change course a number of times during such an\\ninquiry and physical clues, initially thought irrelevant, may become\\ncrucial to a successful resolution of the case.\\nIt is recognized that all crime scenes are unique. The judgment of the\\ninvestigator on the scene, with the assistance of other responders, such as\\nthe prosecutor, should be given deference in the implementation of this\\nguide. It is impossible to propose a single, step-by-step procedure to\\napproach every type of situation. There are, however, fundamental\\nprinciples of investigating a crime scene and preserving evidence that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\crime_investigate.pdf'}, page_content='2\\nshould be practiced in every case. This document is not intended as a\\ncomprehensive or rigid scheme of activities, but as a guide for law\\nenforcement, while recognizing the authority of Federal and State\\nstatutes, case law, and local policies and procedures.\\nAlthough the development of a guide for crime scene investigation is\\ninstructive in addressing issues surrounding the management of crime\\nscenes, the Technical Working Group on Crime Scene Investigation\\n(TWGCSI) recognizes that local logistical and legal conditions may\\ndictate the use of alternative procedures. Further, crime scene investiga-\\ntion procedures that differ from the practices in this guide may not\\nnecessarily invalidate or detract from the evidence in a particular case.\\nThe authors encourage crime scene personnel to develop and continually\\nupdate their knowledge, skills, and abilities with respect to the processing\\nof a crime scene through training. In fact, successful implementation of\\nthis guide can be realized only if staff possess basic (and in some cases\\nadvanced) training in the fundamentals of investigating a crime scene.\\nHowever, this document does not address the mechanics of evidence\\ncollection\\n or the training requirements of investigative personnel.\\nThe application of this guide may vary from case to case. Most of the\\nprocedures described in this document are typically ones that would be\\nfollowed in a major crime scene investigation. Some of the procedures\\nlisted may not necessarily be followed in less serious or less complex\\ninvestigations. In addition, the order in which actions may be performed\\nwill vary depending on the nature of the particular crime scene. In some\\ninvestigations, the responsibilities described in each section may be\\nperformed by the same individual. The authors acknowledge that law\\nenforcement agencies may be faced with the dilemma of responding to\\nmore reported crimes than their resources allow. It is one of the primary\\nresponsibilities of the investigator to assess the case at hand and, after\\njudging the seriousness of the case and the availability of resources, to\\ndecide the level of investigation that will take place. For potentially\\ndevastating situations, such as biological weapons\\n or radiological or'),\n",

The\\nuser should refer to the National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ’s) publications\\nfor fire and arson investigation, bomb and explosives investigation,\\nelectronic crime investigation, and death investigation where applicable.\\nThe authors recognize that the size of the agency, availability of re-\\nsources, and the level of expertise vary greatly from jurisdiction to\\njurisdiction. The experts who have proposed this guide strongly suggest\\nthat agencies unable to adhere to it seek assistance from other agencies.\\nAssistance may take the form of securing additional training, sharing\\nresources, forming partnerships with neighboring jurisdictions, and/or\\nseeking additional funding. The authors also recognize that many agen-\\ncies already have programs in crime scene processing, and much of the\\ninformation contained in this document is derived from these sources,\\nincluding many of the resources identified in the reference list.\\nBased on this guide, agencies may determine that improvements are\\nneeded in their training and policies concerning the investigation of\\ncrime scenes. This guide may be a justification for strengthening an\\nagency’s resources.\\nBackground\\nNIJ was asked by Attorney General Janet Reno in 1995 to study cases in\\nwhich convicted sex offenders were later exonerated by DNA testing.\\nThis study resulted in the 1996 publication, Convicted by Juries, Exoner-\\nated by Science: Case Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish\\nInnocence After Trial. After being briefed on this publication, Attorney\\nGeneral Reno asked NIJ to develop a consistent approach to the process-\\ning of crime scenes. As a result, NIJ initiated the Technical Working\\nGroup on Crime Scene Investigation to develop recommended practices\\nfor crime scene management.'),\n",

The NIJ\\nDirector selected an 11-member planning panel called the National\\nCrime Scene Planning Panel (NCSPP). The NCSPP members represent\\nindependent, multidisciplinary organizations whose constituents are\\nresponsible for investigating, evaluating, and analyzing evidence\\nfrom crime scenes. The rationale for their involvement was twofold:\\nthey represent the diversity of the professional disciplines and each\\norganization is a key stakeholder in the conduct of crime scene investiga-\\ntions and the implementation of this guide.\\nThe NCSPP was charged with the development of the outline for a guide\\nfor crime scene investigations using the format in Death Investigation:\\nA Guide for the Scene Investigator . The NCSPP also was charged with\\nidentifying the expertise necessary for the composition of a Technical\\nWorking Group on Crime Scene Investigation, a task the panel completed\\nat a meeting in Washington, D.C., in August 1998.\\nCandidates for TWGCSI were recommended by organizations represent-\\ning law enforcement, forensic science, crime scene training, the prosecu-\\ntion, and the defense. The following criteria were used to select TWGCSI\\nmembers:\\nu Each member was nominated/selected for the position by the NCSPP,\\nnational organizations, and NIJ’s four regional National Law En-\\nforcement and Corrections Technology Centers—Northeast, South-\\neast, Rocky Mountain, and West.\\nu Each member had specific knowledge regarding the investigation of\\ncrime scenes.\\nu Each member had specific experience with the process of crime\\nscene investigation and the outcomes of positive and negative scene\\ninvestigations.'),\n",

In August 1998, the NCSPP met in Washington, D.C.,\\nto review the existing literature and technology, prepare the project\\nobjectives, and begin the guide development process. The NCSPP’s\\nobjective was to develop an outline for a guide based on existing litera-\\nture and present it for review to the assembled TWGCSI at a later date.\\nDuring this initial session, four investigative tasks were identified. Each\\ntask included subsections which when developed provided a guide for\\ninvestigators to follow while conducting a crime scene investigation.\\nThe guide’s format has the following content:\\nu A statement of principle, citing the rationale for following the guide.\\nu A statement of policy to the investigator on performing each section\\nof the guide.\\nu The procedure for performing each section of the guide.\\nu A summary  statement citing justification for performing the\\nprocedures.\\nTWGCSI meetings.  In December 1998, TWGCSI assembled in\\nWashington, D.C., and, after introductory remarks, separated into four\\nbreakout sections to draft the guide. The four sections were: Arriving at\\nthe Scene: Initial Response/Prioritization of Efforts, Preliminary Docu-\\nmentation and Evaluation of the Scene, Processing the Scene, and\\nCompleting and Recording the Crime Scene Investigation. An editor\\nfrom Aspen Systems Corporation attended each breakout section to\\naudibly record the proceedings. Once all breakout sections completed\\ntheir work, the full TWG reassembled to review the initial draft.\\nThe full TWG met again in January 1999 in Washington, D.C., to make\\nrevisions and complete initial review as a group.

Created by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act\\nof 1968, as amended, NIJ is authorized to support research, evaluation, and demonstration programs,\\ndevelopment of technology, and both national and international information dissemination. Specific\\nmandates of the Act direct NIJ to:\\nu Sponsor special projects, and research and development programs, that will improve and strengthen\\nthe criminal justice system and reduce or prevent crime.\\nu Conduct national demonstration projects that employ innovative or promising approaches for\\nimproving criminal justice.\\nu Develop new technologies to fight crime and improve criminal justice.\\nu Evaluate the effectiveness of criminal justice programs and identify programs that promise to be\\nsuccessful if continued or repeated.\\nu Recommend actions that can be taken by Federal, State, and local governments as well as by private\\norganizations to improve criminal justice.\\nu Carry out research on criminal behavior.\\nu Develop new methods of crime prevention and reduction of crime and delinquency.\\nIn recent years, NIJ has greatly expanded its initiatives, the result of the Violent Crime Control and Law\\nEnforcement Act of 1994 (the Crime Act), partnerships with other Federal agencies and private\\nfoundations, advances in technology, and a new international focus. Some examples of these new\\ninitiatives:\\nu New research and evaluation is exploring key issues in community policing, violence against\\nwomen, sentencing reforms, and specialized courts such as drug courts.\\nu Dual-use technologies are being developed to support national defense and local law enforcement\\nneeds.\\nu Four regional National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Centers and a Border\\nResearch and Technology Center have joined the National Center in Rockville, Maryland.\\nu The causes, treatment, and prevention of violence against women and violence within the family are\\nbeing investigated in cooperation with several agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and\\nHuman Services.\\nu NIJ's links with the international community are being strengthened through membership in the\\nUnited Nations network of criminological institutes; participation in developing the U.N. Criminal\\nJustice Information Network; initiation of UNOJUST (U.N. Online Justice Clearinghouse), which\\nelectronically links the institutes to the U.N. network; and establishment of an NIJ International\\nCenter.\\nu The NIJ-administered criminal justice information clearinghouse, the world’s largest, has improved\\nits online capability.\\nu The Institute’s Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program has been expanded and enhanced. Renamed\\nADAM (Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring), the program will increase the number of drug-testing\\nsites, and its role as a “platform” for studying drug-related crime will grow.\\nu NIJ’s new Crime Mapping Research Center will provide training in computer mapping technology,\\ncollect and archive geocoded crime data, and develop analytic software.\\nu The Institute’s program of intramural research has been expanded and enhanced.\\nThe Institute Director, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, establishes the\\nInstitute's objectives, guided by the priorities of the Office of Justice Programs, the Department of\\nJustice, and the needs of the criminal justice field. The Institute actively solicits the views of criminal\\njustice professionals and researchers in the continuing search for answers that inform public\\npolicymaking in crime and justice.\\nFor information on the National Institute of Justice, please contact:\\nNational Criminal Justice Reference Service\\nBox 6000\\nRockville, MD 20849–6000\\n800–851–3420\\ne-mail: askncjrs@ncjrs.org\\nYou can view or obtain an electronic version of this document from the\\nNCJRS Justice Information Center World Wide Web site.\\nTo access this site, go to http://www.ncjrs.org\\nIf you have questions, call or e-mail NCJRS.\")]"
